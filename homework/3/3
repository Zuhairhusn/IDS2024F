1. Theory, Experiment, Computation

2. Healthcare, Finance, Climate Science

3. Deductive Reasoning, Inductive Reasoning

4. Observational data is a measurement or recording of aspects of reality, but it can be incomplete, biased, or noisy, while reality is the actual state of the world, unaffected by measurement limitations.

5. First stage is Descriptive, Second is Predictive, Third is Prescriptive

6. A logical proposition is a statement that can be either true or false. For example, "It is raining outside" is a proposition because it can either be true or false.

7. in classical deductive reasoning, a proposition cannot be both true and false. For example, "The light is on" cannot be both true and false simultaneously. However, in paraconsistent logic, contradictions may exist without collapsing the system.

8. No. For example, "If it rains, the ground is wet" (A⇒B) does not mean "If the ground is wet, it must have rained" (B⇒A), because other factors (e.g., someone watering the garden) could cause the ground to be wet.

9. A+B represents the logical sum, meaning either A or B or both are true. In the Venn diagram, this includes all areas of both circles (A, B, and their overlap).

10. A·B represents the logical product, meaning both A and B must be true. In the Venn diagram, this would be the area where the two circles overlap.

11. A⇒B means that if A is true, then B must be true. In the Venn diagram, this would show A as a subset of B, where all of A lies within B.

12. While A implies B in the logical sense, it doesn't necessarily mean the alarm caused the burglar, as many other factors could trigger the alarm (ex: malfunction).

13. 
A: The burglar alarm is sounding.
B: The jewelry store window is broken.
C: A masked individual is crawling out of the broken window.
D: The individual is carrying a bag full of expensive jewelry.
E: The masked individual is a burglar.

If A (alarm sounds) and B (window is broken), then something suspicious is happening.
(𝐴∧𝐵)⇒suspicious activity

If C (a masked individual is crawling out) and D (the bag is full of jewelry), then it strongly suggests criminal intent.
(𝐶∧𝐷)⇒criminal activity
If both suspicious and criminal activity are observed, then the masked individual is likely dishonest (E).

(suspicious activity∧criminal activity)⇒𝐸
In short, the policeman uses deductive reasoning from observable facts (A, B, C, D) to conclude that the masked individual is likely a burglar (E).

14. 
a. Bit: The tiniest unit of information, representing 0 or 1 in computers. 
b. This is the smallest amount because it represents the most fundamental binary decision or state (on/off, yes/no).

In a void, you would need an external reference point or another object to define coordinates or detect movement.
Representing Information:
1 box (bit) can represent 2 things (0 or 1).
2 boxes can represent 4 things: 00, 01, 10, 11.
3 boxes can represent 8 things: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.
