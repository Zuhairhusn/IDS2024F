i drew the venn diagram with the use of python.

2. Name the three fundamental desiderata of Probability Theory.
The three fundemental desiderata of probability theory are:
1) Non-Negativity
2) Normalization
3) Additivity

3. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.

9. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?
Scatter Plots, because they're designed to preserve the aspect ratio and avoid the distortion of relationships. (width and height)

10. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.
One scenario would be visualizing financial market volatility over time alongside log returns of an asset in a scatter plot.
The problem here is that the financial market data often has extreme outliers during periods of high volatility, and it uses a linear scale which compresses most of the points into a dense cluster, while extreme outliers dominate the visualization, and this obscures subtle patterns in the normal range.
So the solution to this would be to apply a square root transformation to the volatility axis. Which should help in reducing the influence of extreme values while preserving relative differences. This approach is particularly helpful in risk management or portfolio analysis, where patterns in moderate volatility ranges are as important as the rare extremes.

11. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?
All three coordinate systems are valid, but the thing that matters most is the choice which depends on the context and the nature of the data.

12. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.
Sequential Color Scale (used for representing ordered, quantitative data like temperature, population density, or precipitation.)
Diverging Color Scale (its ideal for showing data with a critical midpoint, like profit/loss, temperature anomalies, or deviations from an average.)
Categorical Color Scale (best for representing qualitative or categorical data like regions, product categories, or demographic groups.)
Perceptually Uniform Color Scale (great for scientific and analytical applications where accurate perception of data is critical, such as heatmaps or topographic maps.)

13. What is wrong with the following visualization? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ce87cc-2f7f-452c-b241-9f50641281cd)
Well firstly, The plot shows density for ages less than 0, which is physically and logically impossible for age data. Also, the density curve might be over smoothed, that may potentially cause unrealistic values at the extremes of the dataset. 

14. Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans?
The bottom palette is more suitable for effective visualization communications. It is more inclusive and offers better contrast for human interpretation compared to the top palette.

15. Prove the Bayes’s rule via Venn diagrams,

all within a framework of a sample space.

16. Name four major schools of Probability Theory.
Bayesian, Classsical, Frequentist, Axiomatic Probability.

17. (extra credit)
I can only identify two, 1) Frog 2) Horse Head.

18. (extra credit)
Move one matchstick from the 6 on the left side of the number, to the "+" sign to turn it into a "−" sign.
The equation would then show:
8−3−4=0
