The quadratic model predicts a significantly higher temperature increase by 2050 and my prediction for the temperature anomaly in 2050 came out to be 1.522∘C (after rounding up. without rounding up my exact value would be 1.5216271533030294). The accelerating trend in the data makes a better representation of reality due to its exponential growth.

1) The two free parameters are called: Epsilon, and MinPts.
2) The instructed parameter was not unique. But one example of a unique parameter is you can increase the large epsilon (ε) even more and keeping Minpts low, such as 2 or 3.
3) So i set a small epsilon (ε) to limit the neighborhood size, which in result made it harder for distant points to belong to a cluster. I then increased MinPts to about 5, so that fewer points qualified to the dense region. Which resulted in an Outlier.

The final set of clusters i got looks alright. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a60695-0acc-4a03-8675-2b73431c58c9)
This new cluster i made does not look like anything i got before. There's many more variations of colors and sections contain more unique shapes and edges. Looks very cool. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8872fec1-1ef1-4238-8dfe-4d706c1b358a)
This is from the other website. I'd say that DBSCAN is more effective for this dataset because it handles non-spherical clusters like the smile or face circle better. It even marks the outliers as noise. It also doesnt really need you to guess the number of clusters either, it just does it for you. Really solid. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256142e0-5a22-41e8-8fa8-c3a555652f6b)

This plot uses a linear x-axis and a logarithmic y-axis which allows us to observe changes that span several orders of magnitude. (10, 100, 1000, etc...). In the initial phase of the three curves (those being blue, yellow, and red) the trend appears linear on the log-log scale which suggests a power-law relationship where the growth follows a formula like y=ax^b, with b indicating how steeply the values increase. However as the curves progress, they start to flatten out in the second phase which indicatates a shift to a non-linear pattern. This flattening suggests saturation.. which means the system is approaching its capacity or limit. This behavior is best described by models like logistic growth or exponential decay toward a maximum, where growth slows as it nears a peak. The blue curve reaches the highest final value while the yellow and red curves plateau at progressively lower levels. The presence of error bars shows variability in the data which increases as the curves approach their respective limits.
