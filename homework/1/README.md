Three types of historical Version Control Systems are:

1. Local Version Control Systems (LVCS) - These store versioned files in a database on your local machine. Developers manually track and save file changes.

2. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) - In a CVCS, a single server hosts all versioned files, and developers check files in and out. An example can be Subversion (SVN) and CVS.

3. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) - In DVCS, every developer has a complete copy of the repository on their machine, which allows for more flexibility and offline work. Git and Mercurial are popular examples.


What is the best?

Distributed Version Control Systems are considered to be the best for modern software development. There are three key elements as to why i say DVCS is the best:

Decentralization, Offline work, and Collaboration. Very plain and simple answer on why it is the best.
