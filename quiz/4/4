1. 
With the given i am provided with finally A↑(A↑A), which just reduces to A with NAND.

2. 
The left side can be expanded. 
A↑A = A
B↑B = B
So left side becomes \\A↓B=A∧B
The right side utilizing the identities for NOR, it proves both sides are equivalent.

3.
I feel like its easier to explain. When you combine the 𝑓1, 𝑓3, and 𝑓4, it reproduces the truth values for A⇒B, proving the equivalence.

4. 
A⇒B≡A+B
B⇒A≡B+A
A+B≡B+A
That proves (A⇒B)≡(B⇒A). 

5.
This uses the application of the De Morgan Law, so we are able to expand C(A+B) 
Which becomes C+A*B.

6. (this took way too much time to make into a table without the use of an external tool because i assumed nicholas would think i was cheating if he saw an external application opened.)
T	T	T	F	F	F	F

F	T	F	T	T	F	F
F	F	F	T	T	T	T
AB and A*B have different truth values in some rows. it proves that it's not equivalent.

T	T	T	F	F	F	F

A+B___ and _A+_B have different truth values in some of the rows. It's not equivalent.
