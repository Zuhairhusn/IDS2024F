1.
Observational data is limited by the accuracy, precision, and methodology of observation, while reality is absolute and unaffected by these constraints.

2.
Position, Color, Size, Shape, Line type, Opacity

3.
The top palette is more appropriate for effective visualization. because It has a higher contrast, Intuitive color progression, and good accessibility for visually impaired viewers.

4.
Categorical (Okabe Ito, ColorBrewer Dark2, ggplot2 hue)
Sequential (ColorBrewer Blues, Heat, Viridis)
Diverging (CARTO Earth, ColorBrewer PiYG, Blue-Red)
Qualitative/Accent (Okabe Ito Accent, Grays with accents, ColorBrewer Accent)

1) Valid. "=" shows equivalence, and breathing involves inhaling and exhaling.
2) Valid. "‚â°" means strict equivalence, and breathing is defined as inhaling and exhaling.
3) Invalid. Breathing can occur without consciousness (e.g., coma, sleep).
4) Invalid. Consciousness isn't required for breathing (e.g., sedation).
5) Invalid. Clouds don‚Äôt always mean rain, so strict equivalence fails.
6) Valid. Rain is usually associated with clouds, so "=" works.

6.
The three pillars are experiment, theory, and simulation.

7. 
No, they aren't the same. Logical implication: A true statement implies another. Physical causation: One event directly causes another. Example: A fire alarm ringing implies fire, but the alarm doesn‚Äôt cause the fire.

1)No, the red line is not a good fit because it oversimplifies the trend. The data has significant fluctuations and non-linear patterns, especially in earlier centuries. A linear fit does not accurately capture the variability or the acceleration of temperature increases in recent years.

2)Epistemic Uncertainty dominates. This period likely lacks accurate measurements due to limited scientific instruments and sparse data collection, resulting in greater uncertainty in the recorded values.

3)Yes, this dataset qualifies as time series data because it represents a sequence of temperature anomalies recorded over regular time intervals (years). Time is a key independent variable, and the dataset shows trends and variations over centuries.

4)The rise in the 1940s could be attributed to industrialization and increased greenhouse gas emissions. The temporary decline might be due to aerosol emissions during World War II, which can have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight, or natural climate variability during that time.

9.
No you can't. Because probabilities are typically represented as real numbers between 0 and 1, including fractions and decimals, to capture precise likelihoods. Integer numbers lack the granularity to represent probabilities accurately.

10.
Non negativity, Normalization, Additivity. This is the criteria which must be satisfied.

11.
1 is equivalent to 1 in decimal.
01 is equivalent to 1 in decimal
10 is equivalent to 2 in decimal.

12.
Not really. Because real numbers cannot be perfectly represented in modern digital computers because they have infinite precision. Instead, computers use floating-point representation, which approximates real numbers within a finite precision.

13.
The expression i finally got matched the condition of (B‚áíA ‚â° B + A) and it proves that he expression is true.

Git = Local Version Control
GitHub = online hosting/collaboration platform for Git repositories.
They are mutually beneficial towards eachother, but they are not the same.

15.
Bayesian Probability theory allows the incorporation of expert knowledge in the form of prior probabilities.

16. 
Bayesian Probability Theory is most useful when data is scarce because it uses prior knowledge to make inferences.

17.
Frequentist Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God because it relies on the concept of relative frequency from repeated observations.

18.
The label "wrong". The bandwidth is too narrow. And the x axis does not have any true specification on the age. Whether if it is truncated, imputed, or includes missing data.

19.
Computers use binary (1 and 0) for representation because they rely on hardware level logic gates that operate on discrete states (high/low voltage). Integers are the simplest way to encode these discrete states.	

20. 
B or ALGOL

21.
FORTRAN which was made in 1957

After applying demorgans law and simplifying, my answer was C(A+B)‚â°C+AB (all of them have a line above)

Deductive and Inductive Reasoning.

Deductive (Premise: All humans are mortal. Premise: Socrates is a human. Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.)

Inductive (Observation: The sun has risen every day for millions of years. Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow.)

25.
What it means is that their truth tables yield identical results for all possible input combinations.

I'll just answer the second question. The symbol | simply  means "given that" or "conditioned upon".

28.
S = 2/33 * (3+99)
S = 16.5*102
S = 16.5*102
S = 1683

29.
The expression A_+B_ represents the logical OR of A_ and B_. Which matches. I proved using bool alg and the definition of the NAND operator.

30.
If ùê∂ = ùê¥ + ùêµ C=A+B, Then C_ can only be true when neither A nor B is true.
Start with C = A+B, Take the complement of C, Apply De Morgans Law, Thus, C_=A_*B_ (Imagine those are the lines above the variables.)

31.
If A implies B, then A must only exist when B is true. Conversely, A=AB captures the same logic, ensuring A and B must both hold for A to exist.
Here's my truth table: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dada58cb-8388-45e6-b302-102bc2bb4ff3)

Aleatory uncertainty is intrinsic because it is fundamental to the nature of the system itself and cannot be eliminated no matter how much we improve our knowledge or methods.
